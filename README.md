# 🧩 Sudoku Solver

A Java-based Sudoku solver that uses backtracking to efficiently solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. This project demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving, object-oriented design, and GUI development using Java Swing.

## 🚀 Features

- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- Uses recursive backtracking algorithm
- Uses BitMap to validate digit placement
- Clean and modular code structure
- Interactive GUI built with Java Swing
- Easy to extend for web or mobile integration

## 🖼️ GUI Overview

The application now includes a graphical user interface built with **Java Swing**:
- Clickable 9x9 grid for input
- "Solve" button to trigger the solver
- Input validation and visual feedback
- Responsive layout and intuitive design

├── src/
│   ├── gui/                # Swing GUI components

```

- `gui/`: Contains Swing-based UI classes
- `solver/`: Contains the Sudoku solving logic
- `Runner.java`: Launches the GUI and solver
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 100%
- Maven (for build and dependency management)
- Swing (for GUI)

## 🧠 Algorithm Overview

The solver uses a classic **backtracking** approach:
1. Find an empty cell
2. Try placing digits 1–9
3. Check if the placement is valid
4. Recursively attempt to solve the rest of the board
5. Backtrack if needed

## 📦 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 8+
- Maven installed

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razat-thapar/sudoku.git
cd sudoku
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.java.razat.sudoku.Runner"
```

> The GUI will launch automatically. You can enter digits manually and click "Solve" to see the solution.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add puzzle generation with difficulty levels
- Enhance GUI with drag-and-drop or animations
- Integrate with a web frontend or mobile app
